With that said, there are situations that come up – especially when it comes to talking. Hair color. A new season brings. New trends And fresh ways to cut, color and highlight hair. Nina owns 5.Th Ave Hair Studio And is a beautiful woman who stays on top of trends and uses her skills when it comes to serving her unisex clients. She is honest with her clients and customizes her looks that will only enhance their beauty, which is a reflection of her work.</p><p>Beauty and fashion remain a passion for her, and she loves to make her clients as attractive as possible. It takes a lot of honesty as she customizes a look that only improves their appearance the happier they are when they first walk through her door.</p><p><img src="../images/gd830b4056501c51e2c661c17c2b84591abf91b0bd53e245eabddf6e26751c8b7c3a6b59dfd542e202806ebb5e6e42942_12801.png" width="620" style="width: 620px;" class="fr-dib fr-fic"></p><p>I was happy to see the salon so busy, but Nina explained how business has changed. “Business has changed in two ways post-Covid. A lot of our clients have moved out and gone crazy for Florida, but the regulars who have been are still coming to see us. We’ve got new clients. have moved to the area, as well as constant referrals bring in a new flow of people. It’s exciting to meet new people and see how happy they are with what we do. We have regulars and are very Supportive. Getting new clients is always a good thing because it brings in a new set of people to work with and make happy. During the holiday season, Nina sees a big increase in clients. “People are going out more and are excited to get on with their lives and feel a sense of normalcy again. It’s nice to share in their excitement and support them when they go on dates, out with friends, holiday parties, etc.” Yes, we’re all happy to have our lives back.</p><p>I was very curious to hear what the new hairstyle trend is these days. “Many of our clients still have shoulder-length hair and then there are some that are always on trend, the bob cut that never goes out of style. We have people asking for extensions because they want holiday hair. And for some, they want to lighten up their hair when they get ready for vacation in the middle of the holidays. This keeps us busy working with so many colors and styles. Brunettes are trending right now. have been, so we’re working with mocha and chocolate tones with lowlights. Blondes are always in style and shall I say, trendsetters. It’s definitely not written in stone, but I keep up with runway looks, magazines and of course social media to stay relevant.</p><p><img src="../images/f25f651065c37cabc9e04ebd6913834435dc1b1fa586406e59f9600d5738780d7a8f56f5a61cfa836cf32d93b5ee5b3b899c0602bcf9a46d99bb5f_1280.png" width="620" style="width: 620px;" class="fr-dib fr-fic"></p><p>Well with all the color, how should your clients and their hair colorists keep it healthy? “I always recommend using a clarifying shampoo to cleanse the scalp and remove product build-up, and it’s always best to use a sulfate- and carbon-free shampoo and conditioner with a protective serum before blow-drying your hair. It will definitely help protect the hair and keep it strong.”</p><p>Our world is obsessed with celebrities, and we know they’re getting quite the buzz right now. Who are your clients asking about these days? “Yes, there are a lot of celebrities right now who have people coming in and asking about their specific cut and color. The celebrities I’m usually asked about are Jennifer Aniston and Jennifer Lopez. My clients love these two beautiful stars and want to copy their looks. Blondes love Jennifer Aniston’s natural balayage and brunettes love Jennifer Lopez and of course the whole package. Gisele’s look is always on trend and even more so since she is in the media daily.</p><p>What charities do you support and how are you spending the holidays to keep the holiday spirit going? “I love to support as much as I can. I’m part of St. Jude, Anchorage Kids Foundation, Ronald McDonald House, and Families in Ukraine. I’m planning to spend the holidays with my loved ones and I’m looking forward to a wonderful 2023. !</p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
