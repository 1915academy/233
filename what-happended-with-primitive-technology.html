Primitive technology is where you build things completely from --- scratch .&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">What happened to Primitive Technology?</span></p><p>today in the modern world, most people are well aware of two things: technology and social media. [Unless you are anything like me thenyou brain will start to go deeper into asking wondering questions with no answer and get determin to find the answer. Social media career is a great example of primitive technology and we need to talk more about it. Premitive technology is not using advance resources, and keep in mind though that there may be certain things that cannot be "reinvented"&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ancient Technology Or Primitive technology :&nbsp;</span></p><p>To get more into this, ive seen YouTube channel using "ancient technology" &nbsp;to build. They added both interests when it just started uploading a person's construction tools and crafts videos using only wild material and its own hands. It quickly became the Internet sensation, which collected more than 10 million users and reached fans around the world. Primitive tech refers to simple or traditional methods. The difference between these two is that acient technology usually refers to the first and the stick, stone and natural age, while primitive is creating invention to make the stone and natural age technology a little earier. If that confuse you, think of it like acient tech: sticks and stone, primitve technogy: a hammer (still natural and basically a stick and stone together).<span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp;And lastyly, Primitive technology is still part of the anxient technology&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Startup :</span></p><p>It will be "ancient technology", which has not been found to fans around the world because of its charming offer or fashion indicators, but in fact because of its naked simplicity and silent reflection.</p><p>The acient technology channel started from an unknown man, just uploading videos of self -construction to build things using natural materials.</p><p>Videos uploaded to ancient technology today you see on YouTube that most of the videos were not like. He was not a sharp or funny celebrity update or makeup and fashion lessons.</p><p>The channel write on its website, "primitive &nbsp;technology is an hobby to make anything in jungle using tools for beginners ."</p><p>"This is a stringent principle. If you want to use a fire, a ax - pick up a stone and make it, a hut from a hut, trees, mud, stones, etc. The task is for how far you can go without technology and expert guide. “</p><p>When fame for this popular YouTuber increased, many people began to wonder about the truth of the man behind the scenes.</p><p>Since ancient technology channel post informative and interesting videos , it began to get more and more populartion from around the world&nbsp;</p><p>The person being acient technology channel grew the interest of acient technology is millions and millions of people around the world.</p><p>He wrote, "It should be clear that I do not live in the wild but follow it only as a hobby." "I live in a modern house and eat modern food."</p><p>The mysterious creator was incredibly honest and open about his creative process.</p><p>He wrote, "I just want to see how people worked and made things in ancient times." "It's a good hobby that keeps you fit and does not raise anything other than time and effort."</p><p>The world was loved by this interesting and pious person who starred in its exciting YouTube videos. Since people saw more and more amazing clips, they have learned about some extremely complex and extraordinary creations from the beginning.</p><p>But when they learned a lesson from this person, there was one thing that everyone was completely unaware of his name.</p><p>Despite his interesting points and videos, and despite being opened about his creation, the man still refused to reveal his identity.</p><p>Since the mysterious man's true identity behind "ancient technology" and why he kept hiding it, the man focused on ignoring and merely focusing on him. How to hide and focus on it began to grow. Creation from the beginning.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><br></p><p>Natural creation :</p><p>His next project was making iron pills, small iron balls, which would provide a lot of support to his natural creations.</p><p>He wrote, "I smelled iron bacteria and prepared a little amount of iron." "In my ongoing struggle to reach Iron's era, more experiments about furnace design and ore treatment were done."</p><p>Since the world was attracted to the mysterious man behind ancient technology and its amazing videos, the man also preferred to keep his original identity a secret.</p><p>But nevertheless, he was happy to answer other types of questions.</p><p>Fans will have to contact to ask things like, "Which dangerous animals are there?" For which he replied happily, "Only the poisonous snake and I need to see where I step. Crocodiles do not live where I build these huts and there are no ground hunters in the bush (which I am aware of).</p><p>Since speculations are growing around the real identity of the man behind ancient technology, he knew that the only way to remove the public from this question was to make this video so interesting, focusing on It will be attracted to it.</p><p><br></p><p>And likewise, he decided to work on his very expensive project so far - from the beginning he created a whole hut.</p><p>He had once tried to make a hut once, but due to the loss of heavy rains, he fell and declined.</p><p>After his initial hut was badly damaged by the rain that he was no longer working, the mysterious man knew that if he wanted to achieve this version, he would have to do a lot of work.</p><p>And so he started from location, changing some important things. This second hut was kept in the open, so that more sunlight could reach it and dry any rain that could fall on it.</p><p>After that he started working on the foundations, which this time he made sure that he was more deep in the ground than ever before.</p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
