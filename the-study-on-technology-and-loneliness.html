Although we use technology to connect, it disconnect us from the in person interaction. This sometimes can cause lonliness because of the physical sense on in person interaction. Technology allow us to gain a sense of self because of the individualitiy it creates, not in a bad way but just give us a sense of self which again isnt bad, i acutally want to engourage you to have a sense of self, it allow you to know what is you, and what is not, and which is not bad at all, &nbsp;sometimes depending on your approach there is a hard way to apporach it because it may make you feel "too different" and too much of " self" meaning, feeling like no one else will understand you, you are the only one who is like this and so forth. &nbsp;The isolation of sense of self can make us feel lonely sometimes. One of the most popular ivention of technology is thatof social media. Social media is a way to conne. And sometimes those feelings can be hard to deal with which can cause loneliness. So technology may cause feeling of more lonely rather than feeling more connected and free without it. Researchers have found that it makes people feel less worried and less free, which is the completely opposite of the creation of technology. Well i dont know the creation of technology, but i know in my society and surrounding it was created to make life easier, and make us more free, less worries.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, technology has become to relies more on social contacts, which is relatively dependent on real -life contacts. &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Technology can feel more lonely because people can rely more on social media contacts than real -life contacts.</span></p><p>Research about technology : &nbsp;</p><p>Recent studies have shown that despite being more connected, more people can feel more lonely than ever, use what i just said above as a guide to understadning this. Another recent study showed that 48 % of respondents had only one confession compared to a similar study 25 years ago when people said they had three people they could trust. Exhibit negative traits such as narcissism in real life. When users post permanently about their lives and presence and try to up or copy Instagram's influence life, it creates selfishness and lack of sympathy for others - The average amount of screen time spent in today's days has increased by 11 hours. This is an increase of nine hours and 45 minutes from last year's research. This is some experience, and those feelings of narcissim does not have to arise with technology, and loniless, when you feel these thinsg you an choose to approach them differetnly, and when you do approach them differently you tend to realized they dissappear. And that is if you don't want to deal with them.&nbsp;</p><p>Technology provides the possibility of working far away, connecting at a distance, also that it connects to all&nbsp; news and its latest developments are able to maintain, and it gives the ability to call with family and friends, and even importantly It is connected to each other. Although technology has created the illusion that everyone is extremely attached, and when people in fact lose real human interaction, which reduces the epidemic of loneliness and the team's commitment. The freedom given by the technology has had an opposite impact on personal needs. Instead of feeling connected to people, they ignite feelings of loneliness and loneliness.</p><p>Technology Connects us on Social media :</p><p>Technology can make people feel more relying on social contacts, then depends on real -life contacts. It is easy to make friends with real life. This shows how much people can be associated with technology. Focusing on the screen makes people forget the difference between being lonely and lonely. Technology negatively affects our social interaction, making it socially strange and lonely.</p><p>Technology has made the world more "connected". The Internet, in which we use all these Nifty gadgets, has increased us more access to information, interaction through social media, and we pay our bills, buy our own and buy our bills. Even the game has been made. People on the other side of the world - they are all comfortable in our own homes. What is the time to survive, some people can say. However, other people argue that far from bringing us closer, technology is in fact leaving us more isolated and lonely.</p><p>According To Survey :</p><p>Whether technology can be directly accused or not, the fact cannot be denied that the world is currently in the bell that is being described as a "epidemic of isolation". A 2018 survey of the Economist and Caesar Family Foundation (KFF) shows that more than fifth (22 %) of American adults say they always feel lonely, lack of companionship. They are, or left or feel isolated. A similar story is going on across the pond, 23 % of adults in the UK are responding similarly.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><br></p><p>These results come to the back of a separate Sugar study, which shows that almost half of Americans always feel lonely (46 %) or leave (47 %). Last year, the British BBC Radio 4 released the results of its "loneliness experience", which found that one -third of the British often feel lonely. Throughout the European Union, about 30 million adults often feel lonely, while in Japan, an estimated half million people close themselves from society, often living in their homes for months.</p><p>Loneliness :</p><p>Loneliness is changing life-even life-threatening-those who experience it. Psychological problems such as alcohol and drug use, eating disorders and depression, the devastating effects of loneliness cannot be promoted. There is also a lot of evidence to suggest that isolation produces psychological as well as psychological problems, and can even lead to death. According to data published in The Independent, an analysis of 300,000 people in 148 studies has shown that loneliness is linked to a 50 % increase in death for any reason. In other words, it does not matter that a person may suffer from illness, loneliness makes him worse and makes it difficult to recover from the condition. In these terms, the analysis was concluded, loneliness can be considered than 15 cigarettes a day, and obesity is more dangerous.</p><p>Study's authors say people need to deal with the negative effects of loneliness, people need real, personally. However, the more we rely on the more technology-home and workplace-to-work-work, completing daily tasks and performing work duties, as little time with our friends, family and fellow workers. Singing face to face, leading us back to the question.</p><p>Although different studies show a slightly different statistics, the overall trend is clear - we are really addicted to technology technology, and especially the use of social media has scored in recent years. A report from the Global Web Index last year estimates that digital users are now spending an average of 22 hours 22 minutes on social networks and messaging services. Young-16-24 children spend more time-which increases about 3 hours a day.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><br></p><p>The use of technology has far -reaching effects on people's daily life. It can be argued that modern technology makes the world more integrated. People enjoy increasing interaction through social networking, increasing information, and without technology it is almost impossible to do something. However, instead of bringing people closer, it seems that the dependence on technology is rapidly causing people to disconnect with public interaction, so more loneliness. Technology is causing people to change their way of understanding themselves and their relationships.</p><p>You think its close you but in real not :</p><p>It is interesting that the thing that brings people closer may be cut off from real life conversation. Most of the technology -based communications are mostly unusual. It seems that the new social media has an interesting ability to promote social connection, but the most important social information of the sender and the recipient is left when diagnosing digital (Lopkini, 2013). Smartphones and other mobile gadgets are particularly accused of withdrawing people from social life. Since smartphones have integrated many features such as internet connectivity and multimedia capabilities, many people check their phones several times a day and spend many hours using gadgets. It is not surprising to be surrounded by people in a room who are engaged in their phone rather than real conversation (Lopesini, 2013). The situation is probably worse for people who do not enjoy communication in front of them because technology keeps them away from the real world.</p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
