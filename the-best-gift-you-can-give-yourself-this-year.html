New Year will bring and you may find that you are already filling your calendar with events and projects. But before you focus on 2023, it’s important to close out the old year with intention.</p><p>Expert and creator of an Self Development Level up through ITI Method book says, “By the end of the year, we may forget a lot that happened. We may think that the year wasn’t so good. However, after writing our annual review, we soon realize that we have already There have been more achievements than can be remembered.</p><p><img src="../images/253af6809462268bd12986cc89c08710ad3b35473c03af7ad42a73a36377b87a7dc045d95e06b59c61467fa3f43318ec664de9837602ff8f98ac8b_1280.jpg" width="620" style="width: 620px;" class="fr-dib fr-fic"></p><p>Sitting down for an annual review takes time, patience, and a bit of anxiety and confrontation. Why spend time doing that when you can watch a festive Netflix movie you might ask?</p><p>Reflecting on the year is a powerful way to understand patterns in your life and if you’re moving in circles. It allows you to find new and better ways to navigate routines and note the wins and losses in your life. Celebrate the wins and empathize with the things that didn’t go so well. Here’s what’s important: the clarity you get is the foundation for new ideas and positive change.</p><p>It’s actually the perfect antidote to the chaos of Christmas to give you some time to reflect and give you a head start on the year ahead, your goals and vision.</p><p>IT Malkin, a self-development expert, says, “Your annual review is really one of the best gift you can give yourself at the end of each year and will give you a solid foundation on which to set your goals. Determine and Achieve.” For me, this has become an integral part of my own personal growth journey and can be even more powerful than creating a vision board.</p><p>OVERVIEW OF THIS ARTICLE</p><p>Often, we get so focused on what our New Year’s goals are that we forget to appreciate the accomplishments of the past 12 months. With 2023 right around the corner, now is the perfect time to write your year-end personal review to pause and reflect on the past twelve months.</p><p>This exercise will help set you up for success in January by reflecting on what you accomplished during the year, what obstacles you faced and overcame, and the most important lessons you learned. learned Think about what else went well in the year, take an honest look at your successes and the things that may not have gone so well.</p><p>Annual reviews are not easy. But when you commit to taking an honest look at your year—your highs, your lows, your actions, your mindset—you change the trajectory of your life.</p><p>THINGS YOU WILL NEED TO DO YOUR REVIEW.</p><p>Plan about two hours of uninterrupted time where you can be alone. Think of it as a mini retreat and create a comfortable environment where you can relax. You can use a table or spread out on the floor. Have a cup of tea, light a candle or do whatever you need to feel and let the creativity flow. Try turning off your phone and notifications.</p><p>You will need some large blank sheets of paper and pen and ideally your Newspapers, notebooks and diaries from year to year so you can review everything. If you use the Notes app on your phone and you tend to store things digitally you can use your phone, just make sure it’s in flight mode for the first part.</p><p><img src="../images/1d0f8e945adb9b7d7406873fa31d47109f537029e05bf51fd43e3094441d7544c072048fa2596198abb6582448c1b42c8126ab8da64702f3e755ec_1280.jpg" width="620" style="width: 620px;" class="fr-dib fr-fic"></p><p>HOW TO GET STARTED</p><p>You can review your year in any way you like and you can review it based on your criteria. You may want to take a direct look at the goals you set in 2022. What goals have you accomplished and what goals are you likely to achieve in 2023?</p><p>You may want to go back through your old journals and notebooks from the year and review month by month. Remember that there isn’t just one way to do it and if you personalize the process, you’re more likely to enjoy it and then it can become an annual ritual that you start to look forward to. .</p><p>The simplest strategy is to divide the review into two parts. Below you will find a series of questions that will both give you a snapshot of where you are right now and will also dig deeper into different areas of life and highlight where you want to make changes. .</p><p>Once you’re settled in your space with everything you need, you can do a short 10-minute meditation to come into the present moment.</p><p>Then take some time to free write in your journal. How are you feeling right now? Are emotions coming up? Don’t judge what you’re writing – it can just be keywords that come up or even ideas. There is no decision.</p><p>Now is the time to start writing down some questions that will help you organize your thoughts and feelings. Again, there is no right or wrong way to do this. Just allow yourself to answer them freely and without judgment. Some may feel more relevant than others.</p><p><img src="../images/4a2bc42dca41c1018e3857ebd2672b9a4b314baa4e3103d65b8016afa3a5ad31a9adcc1b0252a301f6a01ce1631fc0e5d57c305f64716326e547e0_1280.jpg" width="620" style="width: 620px;" class="fr-dib fr-fic"></p><p>GENERAL REVIEW QUESTIONS</p><p>What were the highlights of your year?</p><p>What are you most proud of?</p><p>What went well? What didn’t go well?</p><p>What was the biggest lesson (or lessons) you learned this year?</p><p>What new skills have you learned this year?</p><p>What was the most challenging for you, and how did it make you feel?</p><p>What were your three biggest work achievements? What contributed to them?</p><p>Are there any other goals you’re proud of besides the work you’ve accomplished?</p><p>Have you developed any healthy habits that you want to keep?</p><p>What was the best decision you made all year? What did you learn from it?</p><p>PEOPLE AND RELATIONSHIPS</p><p>How has your relationship with yourself changed this year?</p><p>Who are you most grateful for in your life?</p><p>Who influenced you the most this year and how?</p><p>Who has had the most negative impact on your life? Why?</p><p>What new relationships have improved your life? WHO? How?</p><p>THE YEAR AHEAD</p><p>Now that you’ve reflected on the past 12 months, it’s time to start thinking about 2023. You should now be clear about what you want to do and your aspirations so that you can begin the strategic planning part.</p><p>To get started, answer the following questions.</p><p>What will your dream year look like in 2023?</p><p>What does success mean to you in 2023?</p><p>What three big goals will you achieve in the next year?</p><p>How do your goals for 2023 translate into actionable habits and actions?</p><p>What habits, behaviors, or attitudes will you need to develop or adopt in the next year?</p><p>What habits and behaviors do you need to change?</p><p>Try to dig deep into the questions and answer them fully, actually identifying your why and why behind wanting to achieve each goal.</p><p>TURN YOUR DREAMS INTO ACTIONABLE GOALS.</p><p>You’ve already mastered the deep work of your annual review. What’s left is a plan that helps you move toward your desired 2023 results.</p><p>Once you’ve broken down your dreams into actionable actions, summarize your reflections on a sheet of paper. This summary will be your foundation for 2023. Keep it in a place where you can look at it every day like a mirror.</p><p>A further suggestion would be to break down each goal into manageable steps with monthly progress checks on each goal. dealt with.</p><p>For best results do this review every 3 months, review the previously set goals and add new ones if needed.</p><p>SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR SUCCESS</p><p>Remember that once you’ve set your goal and have a clear roadmap to navigate you need to release your vision. Remember that you can only control so much of the process and that is your mindset and input. Of course there will be some bumps in the road and you’ll need to make adjustments, or maybe you’ll decide that you’re no longer compatible with what you originally planned. The only thing you need to focus on at any given time is the next concrete step.</p><p>I hope these questions help you as you develop goals for the new year, and I also hope they help you honor yourself and your accomplishments.</p><p><img src="../images/383bcd79994bed3e14ddbc9b727a57011b2d65173961ef8d18c7136b1c87a87bade6e86c91ae4b3f3040ed3b3b813285583e1405136ee8ef4c9e7c_1280.jpg" width="620" style="width: 620px;" class="fr-dib fr-fic"></p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
