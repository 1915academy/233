However, it is important that you think carefully how long every post of your blog will be. Blog post length bounce rates, readers' engagement and SEO. But since every blog is different, your maximum blog post length cannot be like other blogs. Keep reading for a guide how long the blog post should be.</p><p>What will we discuss:</p><ul><li>Why Blog Post Focus on Length Affairs</li><li>What do you say on the length of the blog post</li><li>How to determine the ideal length for posts when you start the blog</li><li>The advantages and disadvantages of long -shaped material</li><li>How to start a blog by choosing a blogging platform to help you\</li></ul><p>Why the length of the blog post is important:</p><p>Choosing a maximum blog post length comes with the many benefits of your blog and your website. One of the main reasons for starting blogs is that Google's algorithm is to improve its website and improve their performance on search engines. This process is called SEO, or search engine correction. When it comes to SEO, marketers focus on keyword research and backlinks, but the length of the content can also play a big role in signaling Google that your blog is better than the post competition. Although SEO is an important part of blogging, a great blog will take into account its readers. Users also care about the length of the blog post. The formation of incredibly short posts can close readers who want to find the subject more deeply. On the other hand, posts that revolve for thousands of words can be repeated, dim and unclear. Because of the satisfaction of both SEO and reader your content, it is very important that you think carefully about the length of your posts when you start the blog.</p><p>The Ideal length for blog post:</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no ideal length for blog posts - if there were there, each post would have been counting the same word. Different blogs and different titles require different post lengths.</p><p>However, some studies suggest that an average word is counting, which is mostly obtained by organic traffic results for most blogs.</p><p>According to a 2020 study of Back Lanko, the sweet location sits around 1,447 words for the ideal length of the blog post. In this study, the company found that the top position of the SERP on average Google Search Result Results (SERP) usually includes posts with the number of words.
In other studies, the following word count is ideal for SEO purposes.</p><p>Buffer: 1,600</p><p>Search Engine Journal: 1,900</p><p>VesFD: 1,600</p><p>Material marketing has become one of the most used forms of digital marketing. If you want your blog posts to appear in every Google Search to promote organic traffic from your target audience, the word count between 1,450 and 2,000 words is a good jumping off point.
But let's go in some more detail. Most blog owners - especially those who are new to the game or who want to start a blog from the beginning.</p><p>What is the purpose of your blog posts:</p><p>Your specific goals may mean that the length of your ideal blog post is different from average.
If your goal is to engage with readers and make content they want to read, how long should the blog post be?</p><p>According to the medium, a blog should not be based on the success of the blog post, but instead of how long the readers live in using content.</p><p>If your blog focuses more on building a strong community and a better relationship with your clients, the user's engagement will also be the focus of your attention.</p><p>The medium found that it took about seven minutes to read the ideal post. This will come in about 1,600 words, most people.</p><p>If your goal is to develop a shareable content to improve your social media performance, how long should the blog post be:</p><p>A blog can be an amazing way to create resonance around your social media accounts and improve your digital presence as a brand. For some digital marketers, this may be the main reason for starting a blog.</p><p>According to a study of Moz, these posts, which have a length of 3,000-10,000 words, especially get more shares on Facebook.</p><p>What is your blog style:</p><p>According to SEO expert Neil Patel, long posts of more than a thousand words have become standard for most bloggers. Although in the past, bloggers used to write about 500 500 words posts, it has become less common.</p><p>Small posts can be better than your needs and your topic longer than the subject. There are many blog styles. If you write lightly personal posts, for example, the length of your word can sometimes be less than the "ideal" length we have mentioned above.</p><p>However, make sure to avoid these posts less than 300 words, as it is considered "thin material".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What is the standard in your industry:</p><p>Each industry is different, so "How long should the blog post be?" The answer may be different for you.</p><p>In some industries, long subjects can be normal, while other professionals can develop on short posts. This is usually because the complexity of the topic and readers' habits can change from niche.</p><p>As Nail Patel notes more, the most ideal word counting business is the sales industry, which usually prefers 2500-2,700 words posts. Gadget blogs, on the other hand, flourish with only 300-500 words posts.</p><p>However, for most industries, the ideal length of the blog post sits between 1,500 and 2,000 words. Make sure you follow the relevant trends within it.</p><p>Writing high quality blog posts that are in line with the ideal word length</p><p>Unless you work in a particular industry, there are chances, the ideal length of the blog post for you is between 1,000 to 2,000 words. Blog posts of this length are generally considered long subjects. Many people in the digital marketing industry call this length articles "Long Farm".</p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
