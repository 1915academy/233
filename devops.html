The purpose is to eliminate the difference between any IT organization, the Department of Development Department, and two of the most important departments in the Department of Operations. This blog will help you examine a number of concepts that play an important role in explaining the DOPs. Check the following basic titles of the DOPs discussed below.</p><p>History of DevOps:</p><p>Before the D -Opus came to light, one of the organizations had two separate teams. Development team and operation team.</p><p>The development team worked on the software, developed it, and ensured that the code worked completely. After hours of hard work and a lot of trials and mistakes, the team issues a code that has to be implemented by the Operations Team, which is responsible for the release and operation of the code.</p><p>The Operations team will check the application and its performance and if present, report any worm returning.</p><p>Date of Dupus As simple and planned, when it comes to execution, both big teams always faced controversy.</p><p>For example, we say, the development team developed a code using an I7 processor, 8GB Ram, OS, Ubuntu, and using PHP 5.6 Scripting Language, while the Operations team came with 5 processors, 16GB RAM, OS Santos run the same code and PHP 7.0 programming language.</p><p>When the operation team runs the same code, it will not work.</p><p>This may cause the system environment or any lost software library.</p><p>The Operations team misunderstood this code, though this problem may be in their own system. As a result, the developers and the operations team went a long way.</p><p>To eliminate this gap, the development ('Dev' team and the Operations (OPS) team supported the DOOPS.</p><p>For example, to solve the above problem, the development team surrounded its code into a container, which is a lightweight software environment.</p><p>This software environment contained all the required software, which would require the need to run a code or application.</p><p>When the developers were done with their work, they would send the code to the operations with the operation. The OPS code will run this container as well, and he worked as expected!</p><p>This is for the date of the DOPS. Let's move toward the next part of the introduction of Dupus.</p><p>The life cycle of DevOps:</p><p>Many stages help create the DOPs that is today.</p><p>DO OPS (Development Operations</p><p>This is a permanent process - permanent development, testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring. Let me explain it with an example.</p><p>Instagram is a widely used application around the world. Its work is a huge team behind the curtain, which has permanent development, testing, and its characteristics.</p><p>The developer plans and prepares the code for the application that goes through the test using the test suit, if the test suit is successful, the code is sent into production.</p><p>In a productive environment, the surveillance tool is logged in worms and feature requests by users. For example, Instagram added new features like Instagram stories and IGTVs that were not part of the Instagram application before.</p><p>There was also a bug that slipped on the application that turned the feed into a horizontal scenario and everyone went away. Now it is fixed, but how do you think developers know about these insects?</p><p>It is a constant monitoring that takes a look at these insects and feature requests. Then these impressions are sent to the developers who make changes and re-move the code in the DO OPS life cycle.</p><p>Therefore, from the above example, you can see that the work is permanently applicable, and the development never stops!</p><p>The process of improving the application is the process of adding new features and permanently fixing the insects, at least called the DOOPS life cycle.</p><p>Constant development:</p><p>The developer plans and manufactures the code and uploads it to a GIT version control system which contains the source code. Even after the final release, there are feedbacks that the developer needs to be included in the application. Therefore, this permanent process of improving the application by the developer is called permanent development.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><br></p><p>Continuous testing:</p><p>After uploading the code to the source code platform, it goes through tests with the help of test codes. Each time the source code goes through changes in the code, the code also goes through a permanent fashion before going into production.</p><p>Continuous integration:</p><p>When one step in the DO OPS Life Cycle is completed, the application code has to go to the next number. This is with the help of integration tools. With the help of tools, the development process to consistent the code from one step to the other is called a permanent integration.</p><p>Become a DOOPS specialist through the Intelligence DOOPS Certification Course.</p><p>Continuous deployment:</p><p>Each edition of the feature in the application may require some modification to the application environment. This is called configuration management. We use several tools of deployment to get it. The process of continuously changing the application environment based on the addition of features is called continuous deployment.</p><p>Continuous supervision:</p><p>Even after planning and testing, insects can find their way to production. Monitoring, the monitoring device, permanently maintains a check and keeps an eye on these insects or any other inappropriate system behavior or keeps an eye on the feature requests.</p><p>You can track and maintain the status of some tasks, including the way things are being manufactured using task management software.</p><p>Keep yourself up by learning from interview questions provided by Intelligence.</p><p>Behind each successful phase, there are many tools that help DOPs work smoothly. Here are some important:</p><p>Got:</p><p>It is the most popular, open-source version control system designed to handle all sized projects, so, it is a widely used DOPOP tool in the software industry. The gut allows us to track work progress. We can save all versions of the source code, and if necessary, return to the previous version. The Gut plays a vital role in the constant development of the DO OPS Life Cycle.</p><p>To briefly know about the gut, consider the gut fraud sheet through intelligence.</p><p>Doker:</p><p>Another important tool is a dock. The Dokar makes the development of distribution possible through 'containers' and automatically deployment of apps. The application separates DOC, DOC, separates the DOC, separates the application in separate containers. Doker apps are free from OS and platforms.</p><p>To briefly know about the Doker, consider the Dokar fraud sheet through intelligence.</p><p>Selenium:</p><p>This is a portable software testing framework for web applications. This is an open-source tool</p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
